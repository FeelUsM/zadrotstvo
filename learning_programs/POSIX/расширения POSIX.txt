[CX]  Extension to the ISO C standard 
_ISO_C_
Application developers may make use of an extension as it is supported on all POSIX.1-2017-conforming systems.

With each function or header from the ISO C standard, a statement to the effect that "any conflict is unintentional" is included. 
That is intended to refer to a direct conflict. 
POSIX.1-2017 acts in part as a profile of the ISO C standard, and it may choose to further constrain behaviors allowed to vary by the ISO C standard. 
Such limitations and other compatible differences are not considered conflicts, even if a CX mark is missing. 
The markings are for information only.

Where additional semantics apply to a function or header, the material is identified by use of the CX margin legend.

[MX]  IEC 60559 Floating-Point 
_OPT_
The functionality described is mandated by the ISO C standard only for implementations that define __STDC_IEC_559__.

[MXX]  IEC 60559 Floating-Point Extension
_OPT_
The functionality described is part of the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, but is an extension fo the ISO C standard


--- XSI ---
[OB]  Obsolescent 
The functionality described may be removed in a future version of this volume of POSIX.1-2017. 
Strictly Conforming POSIX Applications and Strictly Conforming XSI Applications shall not use obsolescent features.

Where applicable, the material is identified by use of the OB margin legend.

[OF]  Output Format Incompletely Specified 
The functionality described is an XSI extension. 
The format of the output produced by the utility is not fully specified. 
It is therefore not possible to post-process this output in a consistent fashion. 
Typical problems include unknown length of strings and unspecified field delimiters.

Where applicable, the material is identified by use of the OF margin legend.

[OH]  Optional Header 
In the SYNOPSIS section of some interfaces in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2017 an included header is marked as in the following example:

[OH]
#include <sys/types.h>

#include <grp.h>
struct group *getgrnam(const char *name);

The OH margin legend indicates that the marked header is not required on XSI-conformant systems.

[XSI]  X/Open System Interfaces 
_ISO_C_
The functionality described is part of the X/Open Systems Interfaces option. 
Application developers may confidently make use of such extensions on all systems supporting the X/Open System Interfaces option.

If an entire SYNOPSIS section is shaded and marked XSI, all the functionality described in that reference page is an extension. See XSI Conformance .
