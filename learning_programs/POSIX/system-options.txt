[CX] [Option Start] Extension to the ISO C standard [Option End]
__C__ Application developers may make use of an extension as it is supported on all POSIX.1-2017-conforming systems.
With each function or header from the ISO C standard, a statement to the effect that "any conflict is unintentional" is included. That is intended to refer to a direct conflict. POSIX.1-2017 acts in part as a profile of the ISO C standard, and it may choose to further constrain behaviors allowed to vary by the ISO C standard. Such limitations and other compatible differences are not considered conflicts, even if a CX mark is missing. The markings are for information only.
Where additional semantics apply to a function or header, the material is identified by use of the CX margin legend.


[MX] [Option Start] IEC 60559 Floating-Point [Option End]
__OPT__ The functionality described is mandated by the ISO C standard only for implementations that define __STDC_IEC_559__.
[MXX] [Option Start] IEC 60559 Floating-Point Extension [Option End]
__OPT__ The functionality described is part of the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, but is an extension to the ISO C standard.

[OH] [Option Start] Optional Header [Option End]
In the SYNOPSIS section of some interfaces in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2017 an included header is marked as in the following example:
[OH][Option Start]
#include <sys/types.h>
[Option End]
#include <fcntl.h>
int open(const char *path, int oflag, ...);
The OH margin legend indicates that the optional header defines constants that will be needed if the function is called with certain flag arguments; thus it may be required for some of the functionality described, but is not needed otherwise.


[XSI] [Option Start] X/Open System Interfaces [Option End]
The functionality described is part of the X/Open Systems Interfaces option. 
__C__ Application developers may confidently make use of such extensions on all systems supporting the X/Open System Interfaces option.
If an entire SYNOPSIS section is shaded and marked XSI, all the functionality described in that reference page is an extension. 
See XSI Conformance.
[OB] [Option Start] Obsolescent [Option End]
The functionality described may be removed in a future version of this volume of POSIX.1-2017. 
Strictly Conforming POSIX Applications and Strictly Conforming XSI Applications shall not use obsolescent features.
Where applicable, the material is identified by use of the OB margin legend.
[OF] [Option Start] Output Format Incompletely Specified [Option End]
The functionality described is an XSI extension. 
The format of the output produced by the utility is not fully specified. 
It is therefore not possible to post-process this output in a consistent fashion. 
Typical problems include unknown length of strings and unspecified field delimiters.
Where applicable, the material is identified by use of the OF margin legend.
