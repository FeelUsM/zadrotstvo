0.0	2 Welcome
	the most interesting intellectual endeavors you could embark on at our current time it is right at the intersection of AI and a natural language processing or machine learning 
	and so when we think about you know what are sort of the most interesting manifestations of our human intelligence I think language comes up at the top for most in most answers 
	it is very inextricably linked to thought and also information
	and you know we're an Information Age so natural language processing is an immensely useful piece of technology 
	at the same time deep learning is similar in the sense that it is very broadly applicable 
	you can do speech recognition with deep learning 
	you can do image classification 
	and you can do a lot of different tasks inside natural language processing 
	so deep learning is also a very very interesting tool for you to have going forward in your lives 
	and so basically we're combining these two 
	so it will both be interesting from an academic and intellectual perspective as well as for industry 
	there are a lot of companies out there right now who are trying very hard to hire people with deep learning skills 
	so I think hopefully this will help you both if you decide to work in an academic setting or an industry setting 
	so basically by the end of the lecture you will be able to build an algorithm that can kind of do what you can see here which is it can interpret the sentence like 
	the first 50 minutes were dry but by the end I really enjoyed the lecture
	and so the algorithm here learned what the grammatical structure of that sentence should be 
	and it assigned a label which in this case happens to be a sentiment label - every phrase of that sentence 
	and will basically give you an introduction of why the tree looks the way it does and why it assigns these positive and negative labels 
	so what's kind of amazing here is we did not have to eventually say that you have here a so called contrastive conjunction name but 
	but really we just had to give it a lot of examples 
	and I was able to learn that really you can say the first part is negative 
	and you know the first 15 minutes that is a neutral phrase 
	and then once you say they were dry it becomes negative 
	and then you have a contrastive conjunction which usually 
	which usually means that what comes afterwards matters more in the overall interpretation of the sentence 
	none of that we have to explicitly tell the algorithm but it will be able to pick it up 
	and you will train algorithms that will be able to do that 
	and just as the sentence says we'll start with a couple of boring logistics 
	but you know they're important for you to understand what's going on moving forward 
	and then we'll actually introduce in an almost ridiculously short amount of time natural language processing deep learning and the intersection of the two 
2.49	3 Course Logistcs
	so let's dive right in 
	my name is Richard 
	so sure I actually got a PhD from Stanford last year and happen to work on deep learning for natural language processing and a little bit of computer vision 
	I'm now the founder and CTO of meta mind which is a startup that also happens to do deep learning 
	for those two application fields we have three awesome TAS 
	maybe they can wave their hands 
	we get Ian back there and within the camera francua and poong right there 
	so we'll have four office hours at least 
	if the enrollment stays as high as it is maybe we'll get a fourth one because it'll be a lot of grading otherwise for you three 
	I'm sorry we had to change the time in place we originally had a room from the 60 people and now we have hundred 60 people students enrolled so we had to move to this 
	I hope it's not too bad 
	we'll try our best to actually record all the all the lectures on video and put those up 
	we still need to figure out if we can just put them on YouTube 
	well soon find out hopefully this week we will have a lot of problem sets 
	so basically three problem sets that will make you basically program these kinds of algorithms 
	and there will be a midterm and a final project 
	and in fact the final project is something that you might want to start thinking about starting today 
	this is going to be an important part and hopefully as we go over a bunch of applications
	you'll see you know you have some ideas on what you want to do
	you can find our office hours 
	and soon also office hour locations on the website 
	I'm sorry that will probably not be any course notes 
	but we will put up the slides and the videos shortly after 
	and if I'm on top of my things maybe even before the lecture
4.35	5 Grading Policy
	so the grades for those of you who take not a pass/fail we basically have the three problem sets that count for roughly 1/2 and the midterm is 15% 
	the midterm we want to make sure you actually understand some of the very basics of the math behind what you're programming in the problem sets 
	the final project will be 40% 
	we have a milestone and usually when you start out your project definition you say: oh I'm gonna solve NLP, it's gonna be so great and epic 
	and then we have the milestones 
	and what we often then get 
	I was a TA for 229 in machine learning classes 
	we're struggling collecting the data 
	and that is actually it's a very common problem 
	a lot of these algorithms need a lot of data and just dealing storing a lot of data might not fit on your laptop 
	you might need some other machines 
	so we're going to give you two bonus points or percent of the entire class 
	if you have your data ready and run a single experiment could be just a simple baseline 
	if you actually have some experiments done at the time of the milestone 
	and then the final write-up project and presentation will have a poster presentation instead of that final will be 35 percent 
	are there any questions so far 
	all right 
	so yeah bonus points also for exceptional poster presentations 
	delayed policy we're trying to not have to hear about your grandmother 
	so we'll give you seven free late days 
	you can use them as you please except that you can only use three for one problem set at a time 
	so after three days we want to basically talk about the solutions during the office hours 
	and want to move the class along because the next problem said will be do you know two weeks after 
	and oftentimes they built on top of each other 
	so you want to be able to share the solution 
	so you can turn your problem sets in at most three three days late after you either exceed those 
	or you hand it in no 
	so once you hand it in late it's gone instead 
	if you exceed your seven late days you will lose 25% per late day after that 
	and it unfortunately cannot apply to the final course project because we have to put in the grades into the system 
	so collaboration policy Stanford recently got into the news not so pleasantly 
	so please do read your codebook and the honor code obviously you can you know talk about things during a lecture and your understanding 
	but you have to write down the own solution 
	and most importantly have to program your own solution and not try to find some code somewhere on the internet or something like that 
	on the final project you can actually work in teams of two people 
	and maybe if you have a really ambitious project 
	and you have a very clear setting of what's going on 
	we can make an exception and have three 
	but ideally you'll just be two because otherwise it's hard to attribute who did what 
	all right 
	any questions about all the grading 
	6 High Level Plan for Problem Sets
7.32	4 Pre-requisites
	great 
	alright 
	so prerequisites 
	on a very high-level note I will rather air and decide of boring some people in the beginning 
	and you know make sure everybody gets the very basics of the math and the programming 
	so if you have taken all the prerequisites and you've got a pluses in all of them 
	and you know that was all pretty boring because you already kind of knew it 
	unfortunately you will be a little bored in the first like handful of lectures  maybe two 
	what I found seeing is it's better to err on that side and then we can you know ramp up the speed as we go to more complex models really 
	once you know some of the basic building blocks off deep learning 
	you can very quickly put them together in interesting new ways 
	they're kind of LEGO pieces 
	you just need to understand how they're put together and then build amazing stuff 
	so that being said you will have an easier time if you're proficient in Python 
	all the class assignments will be in Python  
	will use numpy but obviously not packages likes I could learn 
	because that's the kind of stuff we want to learn how to do ourselves 
	so we will you know provide a tutorial here actually from a previous class to 31 and and 
	so let me ask in the room show of hands who would want to have a Python refresher to make sure their can hit the ground running 
	raise your hand 
	okay 
	who does not need a Python refreshment 
	all right 
	well it does seem like there are very few people who really need it 
	so maybe those people in the interest of our TA time I can just talk to some of the TAS they're only like a handful of hands raised hmm 
	and yeah during office hours of course 
	yeah all right 
	college-level calculus and linear algebra will be great 
	so who here know singular value decomposition 
	all right all right 
	I'm that's this is awesome 
	all right 
	you'll have you'll have a great time on Wednesday 
	because well we'll kind of assume that that you know SVD and we can then move to to neural networks more quickly 
	so basic probability and statistics is also good 
	you don't need to know crazy lebesgue measures or anything for deep learning 
	but knowing what the log likelihood is and things like that will make your life a lot easier 
	and really if you've have fully understood CS 229 in all its gory details
	you'll have a lot easier time in general conceptually moving through this class 
	we'll have a lot of cost functions and basically once we write down our cost function everything else will be kind of straightforward 
	you take derivatives sort of a bunch of matrix multiplications 
	and then you run some optimization algorithm like gradient descent 
	any questions on the prerequisites 
10.20	7 What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
	all right 
	so that was the boring part 
	and I'm very hopeful from the hands being raised so far 
	that we can move somewhat quickly through through the early parts of the class material 
	so what is natural language processing 
	again these are very very short descriptions and in some ways it's still a reasonably young field 
	so the the definition is is a little bit subjective 
	but most people I think would agree with the minimum subset here that that 
	I describe which is that natural language processing is a field at the intersection of computer science artificial intelligence and linguistics 
	you will often find researchers working in NLP to be associated with these kinds of departments 
	and you know in some cases some universities have an AI or machine learning Department and most cases AI is kind of part of computer science 
	so the main goal for NLP or natural language processing is for computers to understand and process natural language in order to perform tasks that are useful 
	and in most cases useful to us back as humans 
	for instance question answering 
	of course the the tricky bit is and the reason I put understanding quotation marks is computers don't really understand language the way we understand language 
	there's a lot of you know linguistic knowledge world knowledge and and the connections to thought and planning and you know love life and happiness 
	and all that that will make it very hard for a computer to fully understand and appreciate language 
	so we're and there's actually a lot of interesting stuff in the philosophy of language too 
	and you can spend many many hours reading about Frigga and Vitkenstein and a lot of philosophy of language 
	which we will not do in this class  
	it's very interesting but in order to actually give you tools to you know do what's possible now with deep learning we kind of have to move over that pretty quickly 
	so we'll basically take a very pragmatic approach and look at a lot of tasks that are very concrete and helpful to humans 
	and in some ways perfect language understanding is so-called AI complete problem in the sense that you kind of have to solve almost all of other AI 
	right 
	I can talk about planning 
	I can talk about my motor control in a robot 
	I talk about visual inputs 
	and if you really want to understand what the meaning of greenness you know or blue 
	how do you really do that without seeing the outside world and and so on 
	so it's a very complex problem and in many ways we will simplify it  
12.45	8 NLP Levels
	one thing that has been it is pretty well established inside NLP are different levels of linguistic representation and skill and 
	so it starts with speech or in the case of many computers who don't actually have, you know, microphones 
	or not programmed to deal with speech with raw text those could be pixely scans and in PDF format or something 
	in the case of speech will then do phonetics or phonology 
	it's just the subfield that deal it's basically we're trying to understand speech and map it into a system that humans can understand and analyze 
	and in the case of text we might do optical character recognition and tokenization 
	just finding word do words end and and start 
	and this kind of, you know, tokenization is pretty easy for english, right, we just have spaces 
	but for other languages like Chinese you might not know where specific word starts or ends 
	once you say, all right, I have at least roughly the words that I want to deal with 
	you can then try to understand and analyze these words and that's the subfield of morphology 
	and again for linguists you might start cringing here because any one of those, you know, boxes could be its entire own class right 
	so we're doing a very very bird's-eye view here of the field of NLP and I'm I'm sorry to all the real linguists in the room who who might cringe now 
	so morphology basically tries to understand how words are constructed, you know, if they're prefixes 
	so I could be it unfortunately so on would be a prefix of the overall word unfortunately for instance 

	once you understand the words and, you know, their meaning you in general and sort of traditional NLP you move on to syntactic analysis trying to understand how words are put together 
	so I Can Has Cheezburger for instance does not sound like a syntactically correct phrase in the English language 
	and syntactic or syntax basically tells you what is a reasonable syntactic phrase 
	how this grammar were what is grammatical what is ungrammatical and so on 
	a lot of people in traditional I know key would assume that you need to have the morphological and syntactic understanding order to go to the next one 
	but we'll actually see that in some cases deep learning can move straight into semantics interpretations or semantics 
	which basically deals with trying to understand the meaning of not just a single words but also how they compose into a complete sentence 
	and once we understand the meaning of a sentence which is also a tricky bit and there are lots of different definitions of what is actually the meaning of a sentence 
	once we understand that we can maybe go to discourse analysis or pragmatics which tries to deal with and tries to understand how multiple sentences from the meaning of an entire story, you know, a novel or a, you know, conversation between people 
	which can be very useful once you want to have a phone agent or something that can let you book a flight ticket and wants to need to keep track of the things you've said already in the past 
	we will mostly focus on syntactic and semantic interpretations in the class but there will be a little bit of phonetics because and in phonology because speech recognition has been somewhat revolutionized by deep learning 
	so it's still part of NLP a lot of people put speech into a little subsection of four separate from NLP but clearly speech is part of language processing 
	so mostly will focus on semantic and syntactic interpretations which are al
	so the ones that are closer to the real tasks that we might care about 
	so what what could those be that any questions 
	so far about the different LP levels just a head scratch alright  
16.25	9 (A tiny simple) NLP applications
19.26	10 NLP in industry
21.43	11 Why is NLP hard?
	so let's have one very very oversimplified slide on why natural language processing is actually hard
	so I kind of alluded to this before but there's really a huge amount of complexity in representing and learning automatically a lot of different types of knowledge
	so we have linguistic knowledge 
	we know what grammar, you know, what kinds of sentences give us, you know, what kind of sentences are correct or not 
	we have situational knowledge I know that there are certain things I can say in certain situations and not in others 
	we have a lot of world knowledge visual knowledge that we might be referring to and so on
	so that is that is one of the examples
	so here for instance let's let's assume we try to build an algorithm that understands who she is in this sentence right here
	so this ends this Jane hit June and then she fell
	so now who is she 
	right well wait OOP 
	June exactly 
	and then but now it's the sentences Jane had June and then she ran
	so now you know it's actually almost ambiguous ambiguous again because it could be well you got hidden and you want to run away or you hit somebody and then you ran away
	so again there's almost situational knowledge but here you know it's more likely to be Jane than June 
	and it's in some sense it's probabilistic but in the first case it's very clear that it was June 
	and
	so being like how do we now represent those that fact that we just you know for us is very intuitive who she is depending on on the verb 
	how do we instill that in an algorithm 
	and that will be one of the big questions and we'll provide one so you should know deep learning and it's not the only one but it's actually one that that I think moving forward is going to be very powerful
	so so that is that is the first large problem and then the second one is ambiguity
	so here we have a sentence I made her duck
	so who here has you know an interpretation of what that could mean rephrased 
	yes exactly 
	I made her a duck and it tasted very good 
	you know 
	exactly maybe in the end you have a wooden duck or something
	so you made her you carved one for her yeah 
	exactly 
	like that 
	and there's one there's a fourth one dead uh 
	yes 
	you what 
	like a master plan 
	interesting all right 
	I did not think of that one before there's one that s actually very similar to the first one which is you know I cook the duck for her which could be I cooked the duck that she owned
	so I actually made her duck and not you know my other friends stuff
	so lots of ambiguity right and you can probably think of even more
